1. Sprint

Made Classes Category, Notification, Rent and User and started to build GUI. Need to make changes to GUI since
plan changed a bit from the original plan. Also, I accidentally made 3 different GUI rather than one with
3 pages. Currently, I don't know how to get 3 different GUI to one, but I will be working on that for next sprint.
Classes don't have yet all methods they need to have, but I will implement more methods during next sprint too.

2. Sprint
Some details were added to different methods and classes for example incorrect inputs when making a new notification is now handled.
Added GUI's together so that now you can make a new notification from addNotification button which opens createNotification page.
Created a filewriter and filereader so that every new notification is written to jsonFile.txt, and it can be read from their too.
I created also rent making page. Currently, it is useless because I wasn't able to get certain notifications information on that page but
that is probably next thing to do. Also getting notifications to starting page has to be done next, so I can make progress with rest of the things.

3.sprint
Notifciations are now added to starting page atomatically from the files. When you press any of those notification buttons rent making page
opens with that notification information. Also, you can choose whether you want to rent that product for few hours for some day or to multiple days.
Wrong inputs are handled in that page by showing error alerts. Currently, when making a rent, app just prints that rent to console. I need to add
things to rent such as that product updates its reserved days, and in starting page you can see reserved products and available products seperately,
if user wants so. Also, some details like comments to notifications needs to be added.
